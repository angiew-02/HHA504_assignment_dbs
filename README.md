# Reflections
* Both Azure and GCP had similar process when creating SQL instances however, it took more steps to create the Azure SQL instance
* Took longer for Azure to process and create the SQL instance then GCP
* GCP shows more types of monitoring comapred to Azure
* GCP has more steps in deleting the SQL instance then Azure
* Overall GCP is easier to use then Azure
